This code creates a webpage with a button that, when clicked, displays five random FPV tricks.<br>
Each click will give you a new set of five tricks.<br>
Each links open in a new tab. The `prowhooper.com` part is removed from the displayed link for better readability.<br>

To add your own links and use this code offline:<br>
**Save:** Save the code as an HTML file (e.g., `RandomFPVTrickGenerator`).<br>
**Open:** Open the HTML file in a web browser.<br>
<br>
To edit links right click the saved .html document and 'open with' a text editor, add your links in the links section following the same format, and re-save as a .html document.
